# True-and-Fake-News-detection-using-K-means-clusteringusing

Here I present an analysis of a text clustering project aimed at 
categorizing news articles as either fake or real. The project involves preprocessing 
textual data, utilizing Word2Vec for feature extraction, applying KMeans clustering, 
and evaluating the clustering accuracy. The goal is to enhance the understanding of 
the text analysis process and assess the efficacy of the applied approach.
